Install Arduino, and add the TouchBoard software.

Use this web site, but see the notes below:
www.bareconductive.com/make/setting-up-arduino-with-your-touch-board

You MUST install Arduino from arduino.cc, NOT from the Microsoft store.

  - When you get to arduino.cc, click on the "Software --> Downloads" menu
    item at the top of the page.

  - Select Windows Installer, for Windows XP and up. (You can also select
    the "Windows ZIP files for non admin install" if you don't have
    administrator privileges on your Windows computer.)

  - After it downloads, navigate to the file you downloaded and run
    it. (The browser usually shows the file and you can run it from your
    browser.) It will install Arduino.

After Arduino is installed, run the program, then immediately quit.

When you run the TouchBoard installer, you may get a message, "Windows
protected your PC ...". Click on the "More info" link, then click the "Run
Anyway" button.

The installer will ask, "Do you want to allow this app from an unknown
publisher to make changes to your device?" Answer "Yes".
