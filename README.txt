These functions "wrap" the complexity of the BareConductive Touch Board(tm)
into a simple, easy-to-understand set of functions.

The TouchBoard comes with a number of example Arduino sketches that are
very helpful, but they are "low level" code that is complex and inscrutable
to those not "versed in the art" of C++ programming. This BtUtils library
provides a simplified "wrapper" for the TouchBoard functionality with the
hope of making the technology more accessible to non-programmers.

The key features provided by the BtUtils library are:
  * Simplified volume control.
  * Simplified method for checking the touch sensors.
  * Simplified method for starting and stopping audio tracks, and
    checking their status
  * Volume fade-in/fade-out.
